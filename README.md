Developed a full data mining pipeline to predict B-cell epitopes for a human pathogen, applying a
Random Forest classifier with Mutual Information-based feature selection .
â€¢ Applied advanced pre-processing strategies to handle complex challenges like class imbalance and
grouped data, resulting in a predictive model with significant potential for early-stage vaccine de-
velopment.
